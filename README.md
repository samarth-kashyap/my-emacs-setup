### My emacs configuration file
Lots of cleaning up to do. However, it's already setup to work with python auto-complete.

Update your init.el file and then enter
```M-x evaluate-buffer```
in the mini-buffer to reload emacs.

In case packages are not already installed, then install package using
```M-x package-install RET package-name```
This will be automated in the future, so that the setup is seamless.
